Here's a sample `README.md` file for your GitHub repository that explains the logic and structure of the Slack-like chat app:

---

# **Slack-like Chat App**

This project is a Flutter-based chat application that mirrors several core features of Slack, such as individual and group chat messaging, message read receipts, typing indicators, group management, and more. It’s designed for scalability, allowing for future enhancements such as file sharing, voice notes, and video calling.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Unified Chat List**
- The app displays a unified chat list, combining both individual and group chats in one screen.
- For each chat, the last message, the sender, and the timestamp of the message are shown.
- Chat list also displays the number of unread messages and shows if any participant is currently typing.

### **2. Real-Time Features**
- **Typing Indicator**: Users can see in real-time when other participants are typing.
- **Online Status**: Users’ online status or last seen timestamp is shown in each chat.
- **Message Read Receipts**: Tracks which participants have read a message in both group and individual chats.
  
### **3. Group-Specific Features**
- Group chats allow for the following functionality:
  - Group member list: All members of the group are displayed.
  - Group admin control: Admins can add/remove members and delete the group.
  - Message broadcasting: Messages sent by any member of the group are visible to all participants.
  
### **4. Group Creation and Management**
- Only admins can create or delete groups.
- Group admins have the ability to add or remove members.
- Groups also maintain a participant list.

## **Data Models**

### **Chat List Model**
The Chat List shows both group and individual chats in a single screen. The model includes:
```dart
class Chat {
  final String id;               // Unique identifier for the chat.
  final String name;             // Name of the user or group.
  final bool isGroup;            // Boolean indicating whether it's a group chat.
  final String lastMessage;      // The content of the last message.
  final DateTime lastMessageTime; // Timestamp of the last message sent.
  final String lastMessageSender; // Name of the user who sent the last message.
  final int unreadCount;         // Number of unread messages in this chat.
  final bool isTyping;           // Indicates if someone is currently typing in this chat.
}
```

### **Group Chat Model**
The group chat model contains all relevant information about the group:
```dart
class GroupChat {
  final String id;                   // Unique group ID.
  final String groupName;            // Name of the group.
  final String adminId;              // ID of the group admin.
  final List<User> participants;     // List of users in the group.
  final DateTime createdAt;          // Timestamp for group creation.
  final List<GroupMessage> messages; // List of messages in the group.

  GroupChat({
    required this.id,
    required this.groupName,
    required this.adminId,
    required this.participants,
    required this.createdAt,
    this.messages = const [],
  });
}
```

### **Group Message Model**
The group message model tracks every message in a group chat:
```dart
class GroupMessage {
  final String messageId;       // Unique message ID.
  final String senderId;        // ID of the user who sent the message.
  final String content;         // The actual message content.
  final DateTime sentAt;        // Timestamp for when the message was sent.
  final bool isEdited;          // Indicates if the message has been edited.
  final bool isDeleted;         // Indicates if the message has been deleted.
  final List<String> readBy;    // List of user IDs who have read the message.

  GroupMessage({
    required this.messageId,
    required this.senderId,
    required this.content,
    required this.sentAt,
    this.isEdited = false,
    this.isDeleted = false,
    this.readBy = const [],
  });
}
```

### **User Model**
The user model includes information about individual users:
```dart
class User {
  final String id;               // Unique user ID.
  final String name;             // User's name.
  final String profilePhotoUrl;  // URL for the user's profile photo.
  final bool isAdmin;            // Whether the user is an admin in the group or not.

  User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.profilePhotoUrl,
    this.isAdmin = false,        // Default to false unless explicitly set.
  });
}
```

---

## **Backend API Endpoints**

### **1. Online/Last Seen Status**
The backend exposes an endpoint to fetch the online or last seen status of users. When a user logs in or performs any action, the backend should update their status.

### **2. Message Read Receipts**
When a user views a message, the app makes a call to the backend to update the `readBy` list for that message. This indicates which users have read the message.

#### **Example API Call for Marking Message as Read**:
```dart
Future<void> markMessageAsRead(String messageId, String userId) async {
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('https://api.yourapp.com/messages/$messageId/read'),
    body: jsonEncode({'userId': userId}),
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    setState(() {
      // Update UI to show that the message is marked as read
    });
  }
}
```

#### **Example for Checking Read Receipts**:
```dart
void checkReadReceipts(String messageId) {
  socket.on('messageRead', (data) {
    if (data['messageId'] == messageId) {
      setState(() {
        readBy = List<String>.from(data['readBy']);
      });
    }
  });
}
```

## **Technologies and Tools Used**

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development.
- **Web Sockets**: For real-time communication features like typing indicators and read receipts.
- **REST API**: Used to manage chats, messages, user data, and online statuses.
- **Backend**: Built using a custom backend for managing user data, chat messages, and group functionalities.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Rich Media Sharing**: Allow sharing images, videos, and documents.
2. **Voice Notes**: Integrate voice recording and sending features.
3. **Video Calls**: Implement group and individual video calling functionality.
4. **Channels and Threads**: Add more Slack-like functionalities such as channels and message threading.
5. **Notifications**: Push notifications for new messages, group mentions, etc.
